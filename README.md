# AmpharosInTBOIMod

### This mod was originally made for Afterbirth+. Even though we aren't going to work on that version of the mod, you can [check it out here](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2103830939)

Now entering the Basement, it's Pokemon #181, better known as Ampharos!

This mod is unfinished, but we plan to bring the large yellow sheep creature into the world of the basement, along with a few items, and a Tainted form with a special gimmick!
