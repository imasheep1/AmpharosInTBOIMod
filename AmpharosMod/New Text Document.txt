-----V1.7 Change Notes-----

BIG UPDATE

COMPLETELY REDID THE MAIN.LUA USING MANAPHOENIX'S CHARACTER TEMPLATE 
(Thanks for making this and adding the features for it, you made this mod much better lol)

- Added Tainted Ampharos 
     - Unfinished
     - Lacking main item and gimmick
     - Unfinished stats
     - Literally just normal ampharos but reskinned and without Jacob's Ladder
     - You can play them if you want, but I would recommend sticking to the normal version
     - Yes I know the sprite between floors just says "Placeholder", thats intentional 
- Added door sprite for T. Ampharos
- Added the stuff for both the placeholder character select screen and final characrer select screen

- Added costumes 
     - Ampharos Tail
     - Ampharos ears/head gem
     - T. Ampharos Tail
     - T. Ampharos head gem
FINALLY THE ISSUE WITH THE TAIL BEING IN FRONT OF YOU WHEN WALKING UP IS FIXED WOOOOOOOO
As a bonus they stay with you when you get items

- Added a bit of life to the tail
    - It moves a bit when walking like tails should

- Removed the costume for the Jacob's Ladder starting item 
     - Only applies to the starting one Ampharos gets

- Rebalanced the stats 


-----DESCRIPTION-----

Its Pokemon #181
Better known as: Ampharos
The large yellow Sheep thing, first introduced in Generation 2 is now in the basement

He starts with Jacob's Ladder

At this point its probably just Isaac in a costume because if it was a trainer sending their pokemon to train, the trainer would probably be breaking some laws

THE TAINTED AMPHAROS IS UNFINISHED
ALL I HAVE RIGHT NOW ARE SPRITES
T. AMPHAROS IS PLAYABLE BUT WILL CHANGE IN THE FUTURE

The text in T. Ampharos' character select is a font from Pokemon Firered/Leafgreen. Since it wont be there in the final version I didn't make it the font used for the rest of the characters
