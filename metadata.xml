Its Pokemon #181
Better known as: Ampharos
The large yellow Sheep thing, first introduced in Generation 2, is now in the basement

He starts with Jacob's Ladder

At this point its probably just Isaac in a costume because if it was a trainer sending their pokemon to train, the trainer would probably be breaking some laws

THE TAINTED AMPHAROS IS UNFINISHED
ALL I HAVE RIGHT NOW ARE SPRITES
T. AMPHAROS IS PLAYABLE BUT WILL CHANGE IN THE FUTURE

The text in T. Ampharos' character select is a font from Pokemon Firered/Leafgreen. Since it wont be there in the final version I didn't make it the font used for the rest of the characters
